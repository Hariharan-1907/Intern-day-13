# Intern-day-13
"On Day 13 of my internship, I started learning the basics of Bootstrap, a popular front-end framework. I explored its grid system, responsive design utilities, and built-in components like buttons and forms. This learning will help in creating visually appealing and mobile-friendly web pages efficiently. "
